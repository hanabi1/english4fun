INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
====================

1. Move config.php from the folder /documentation to /application/config/

2 . Move /documentation/.htaccess(ta-bort-denna-parantes) to the root

3. Rename it to .htaccess and change base path to yours.

	ex. 
	//RewriteBase /plugg/git/coop-tekhog/

4 . Modify the base path in config.php to your own project home folder
	WARNING don't forget the / at the end

	ex:
    //define('URL', 'http://localhost/samhalls_sar/');

5. Input your DB password in config.php.
   It's usually blank...
   
   ex:
   //define('DB_PASS', '');

6. Create a DB called 'samhalls_sar' (utf-8) with Sequel Pro or Heidi etc
 

7. Copy the DB export's SQL into the SQL query window and...PRESTO!

   Congrats! It should now work!
